## Introduction to Data Analysis & Machine Learning with Python

Welcome to this repository! Here you will find a collection of Jupyter notebooks designed to introduce you to the core Python libraries used in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning. This resource aims to build a foundational understanding that will help you progress smoothly into more advanced topics.

## What Youâ€™ll Learn

1. **NumPy**:  
   - Understanding arrays, vectorization, and fundamental numerical computations.  
   - Performing basic mathematical operations and array manipulations efficiently.

2. **Pandas**:  
   - Importing, cleaning, and exploring datasets.  
   - Using DataFrames to handle tabular data, perform group-by operations, and handle missing data.  
   - Performing data wrangling and basic exploratory data analysis (EDA).

3. **Matplotlib**:  
   - Creating line plots, bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, and more.  
   - Customizing plots with titles, labels, legends, and annotations.  
   - Building clear, publication-quality visualizations.

4. **scikit-learn**:  
   - Understanding the basics of machine learning models, both supervised and unsupervised.  
   - Exploring essential tools like train-test splits, model evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.  
   - Training simple models such as linear regression and decision trees.
